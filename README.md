# Courser
With Courser you can learn words by creating a courses, add words to them and learn them even when no network connection is available. You can also save your courses to Dropbox and share your courses with others.

# Usage
Creating a course is a 2 step process: 1) create the course 2) add entries.

__In the below explanation the example is a course to learn Chinese from English. But you can learn everything as long it has a question and an answer.__

__Create the course by entering some information__
* Title _Chinese - English Course_
* Question _Chinese_
* Answer _English_
* Optional third field (leave empty when you don't need this) - _Pinyin_
* Test types _Show Chinese, select English_ and _Show English, select Chinese_ (this means the test will show a Chinese word and let you choose between 4 English words, or vice versa)
* Other test types are _Show Chinese, type English_ and _Show English, type Chinese_ that will allow you to type the correct answer instead of choosing between 4 answers.

__Add some entries__
Now add as much questions (Chinese), answers (English) and pinyin as you wish.

__Shuffle__

__Test__
You'll see a Chinese or English word and you have to choose between 4 meanings.

# FAQ
## When are the changes saved to Dropbox?
Every 10 seconds the app looks if somethings has changed and if so (and you are online and connected to Dropbox), the changes are saved. You can always save it yourself by choosing the option from the menu on the main screen.
## How can I use it fullscreen on mobile?
Go to [https://michielvaneerd.github.io/courser/index.html](https://michielvaneerd.github.io/courser/index.html) and on Android choose settings and then add to homescreen. Then it will just look like a standalone app.
